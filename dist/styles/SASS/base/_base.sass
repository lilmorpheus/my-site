/*I think I want the background to be static, with the idea of 
    more of the image shown depending on screen dimensions

    Then you can scroll down  and see more content without the image moving.
        This means the body (background) is just the window essentially
        Then I ahve the wrapper which contains the content which is the size of the whole content

    Ideally I think it would be nice that the title starts in the middle and as you scroll it moves up
        and then settles smaller at teh top of the page
            
    I think thsi is goig to require designing before it can actually be implemented. Also
        I might just keep my about page simle for now and base similar to Charley's*/
